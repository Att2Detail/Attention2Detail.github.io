<p>Serenity Sharpthorne - Customer Service Rep - Has been in the car detailing business for almost 5 years alongside her twin sister Selena. - "Just like my sister, I like helping the people that aren't really sure what they want from their vehicle. We may only be on the phone taking calls majority of the time we work, but we can still help, even if it's just making customers feel comfortable using our service."<p>

<p>Kavana Kendellbrook - Lead Window Tinter - Has been professionally tinting windows for almost 10 years. - "When I was younger, I was always fascinated by car window tinting, so when my older cousin opened up his own shop in Dallas, TX, he let me join as an "intern" and I've been getting better and better ever since. All my hard work has paid off for the last 10 years and now I'm here as Lead Window Tinter."<p>

<p>Bali Hai - Lead Detailer - Has been detailing car and truck interiors for almost 5 years. "I can't stand a nasty car interior and when my siblings would always use my car, they would mess it up so bad and I would have to clean after them every time since it was MY car. At first I hated doing it, but the more it happend the more I started enjoying it, to the point where I'd go around the neighborhood and clean people's vehicle interiors to earn a little cash. They all were very satisfied with my services."<p>
